        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
        Hello! My name is Jenny Lee and I am a 2nd year undergraduate studying
        to get my B.S. in Computer Science with a specialization in Information at UCI!
        Before I go into detail, I was born and raised in Los Angeles,
        although my mom is from Vietnam and my dad is from Cambodia. Ever since I was little,
        I enjoyed writing plenty of things such as short stories, and this was just the beginning
        of my passion I have towards creative work. Towards middle school, I grew a liking
        for math and started winning plenty of math competitions. In high school,
        I continued to show my talent in art by painting lockers for the school
        and even doing murals for them as well. In addition, this was also when I first
        grew interest in Computer Science. I enjoyed web development but explored other areas
        by becoming project manager for robots coders and builders. Now, I
        am half way done with UCI and am interning for CodePath, as well as taking the role
        of project lead this summer for UCI club, "Commit the Change."
